To play the demo go to the release titled "Group Assignment 2" and download the zip 

Within the zip file called "Builds" you should be able to access the .exe which is under the name "New Dawn Aether Hearts.exe"

To move the camera tap space and then touch the edges of the screen with your mouse

Once you spawn in a unit use right click to select it and left click where you want it to go

(The enemies will be to the player's right)
